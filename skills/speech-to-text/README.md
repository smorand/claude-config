# Speech-to-Text Transcription Tool (Go Version)

A Go-based audio transcription tool using Google Vertex AI Gemini models. This tool transcribes audio files as structured **meeting minutes** with automatic attendee name detection, speaker attribution, and markdown formatting.

## Features

- **Meeting Minutes Format**: Automatically formats output as structured markdown with attendees list and conversation
- **Attendee Name Detection**: Identifies speaker names from the conversation
- **Auto-Chunking**: Splits audio files longer than 30 minutes with 30-second overlaps for seamless reconstruction
- **Parallel Transcription**: Processes multiple chunks concurrently (max 3 workers)
- **One-Pass Merging**: AI-based reconciliation of all chunks in a single API call
- **Multiple Audio Format Support**: MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, OGG, FLAC
- **Language Preservation**: Maintains the original audio language
- **Timestamped Logging**: Detailed progress logs with timestamps on stderr
- **Single Binary**: Compiled Go binary with no dependencies

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI API enabled
- GCP authentication configured (via gcloud or service account)
- `ffmpeg` installed on your system (for audio processing)

## Installation

### Install ffmpeg

```bash
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# Windows
# Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

### Build the Binary

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd speech-to-text-go

# Run the build script
./build.sh
```

This will:
1. Download all Go dependencies
2. Compile the code
3. Create the `speech-to-text` binary in the current directory

## Configuration

### 1. Enable Vertex AI API

Make sure Vertex AI API is enabled in your GCP project:

```bash
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com --project=your-project-id
```

### 2. Authentication

Authenticate with GCP:

```bash
# Standard authentication
gcloud auth application-default login

# Or for ADM account (sensitive operations)
gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account=your-adm-account@domain.com
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and set your GCP project:

```bash
# Required: Your GCP Project ID
GCP_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id

# Optional: GCP region (default: global)
GCP_LOCATION=global
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Transcribe and display in terminal
./speech-to-text path/to/audio/file.mp3

# Save meeting minutes to markdown file
./speech-to-text audio.mp3 -o minutes.md

# Specify custom meeting name
./speech-to-text audio.mp3 -o minutes.md -m "Weekly Team Sync"
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Use different Gemini model
./speech-to-text audio.mp3 -model gemini-2.5-pro

# Specify project explicitly
./speech-to-text audio.mp3 -project my-gcp-project

# Custom meeting name with output file
./speech-to-text recording.ogg -o meeting.md -m "Q4 Planning Session"

# Different GCP location
./speech-to-text audio.mp3 -location us-central1
```

### Command-Line Options

```
<audio-file>          Path to the audio file to transcribe (positional argument, required)
-o string             Output file path in markdown format (optional)
-m string             Custom meeting name for the title (optional, defaults to filename)
-project string       GCP project ID (default: "oa-data-btdpexploration-np")
-location string      GCP location (default: "global")
-model string         Gemini model to use (default: "gemini-2.5-flash")
```

## Output Format

The transcription is formatted as structured markdown meeting minutes:

```markdown
# Meeting Name

## Attendees
- Sebastien Morand
- John Doe
- Jane Smith

## Minutes
- **Sebastien Morand**: Welcome everyone, let's start with the quarterly review...
- **John Doe**: Thank you. I'd like to discuss the budget allocation...
- **Jane Smith**: I agree with John's points. Additionally, we should consider...
```

## How It Works

### Audio Processing

1. **Duration Check**: Determines if audio is longer than 30 minutes
2. **Chunking** (if needed):
   - Splits audio into 30-minute chunks using ffmpeg
   - Includes 30-second overlaps between chunks
   - Processes chunks in parallel (max 3 concurrent workers)

### Transcription

1. **Name Detection**: Gemini identifies attendee names from the conversation
2. **Speaker Attribution**: Associates each statement with the correct speaker
3. **Verbatim Transcription**: Captures exact words without summarization
4. **Markdown Formatting**: Structures output as meeting minutes

### Intelligent Merging

1. **One-Pass Merge**: All chunks sent to AI in a single API call
2. **Overlap Detection**: AI identifies the 30-second overlap between consecutive chunks
3. **Duplicate Removal**: Seamlessly removes repeated content
4. **Attendee Consolidation**: Merges attendee lists without duplicates
5. **Continuity Preservation**: Maintains natural conversation flow

## Logging

All progress logs are written to stderr with timestamps in format `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]`:

## Supported Audio Formats

- MP3 (`.mp3`)
- WAV (`.wav`)
- M4A (`.m4a`)
- AAC (`.aac`)
- OGG (`.ogg`)
- FLAC (`.flac`)

## Limitations

- Audio chunking happens at fixed 30-minute intervals (may split mid-sentence)
- Requires active internet connection
- Vertex AI costs apply based on model usage
- Large files may take several minutes to process
- Rate limits may apply (429 errors) - wait a few minutes and retry

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

Re-authenticate with GCP:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Project Not Found

Ensure `GCP_PROJECT` is set correctly in `.env` or passed via `--project` flag.

### API Not Enabled

Enable Vertex AI API:
```bash
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com --project=your-project-id
```

### Rate Limit (429) Error

The Gemini API has rate limits. Wait a few minutes before retrying.

### ffmpeg Not Found

Install ffmpeg:
```bash
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

### Build Errors

Make sure you have Go 1.21+ installed:
```bash
go version
```

Update dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```
